# Write a program that keeps names and email addresses in a dictionary as key-value pairs. The program should
# display a menu that lets the user look up a person's email address, add a new name and email address, change
# an existing email address, and delete an existing name and email address. The program should pickle the
# dictionary and save it to a file when the user exits the program. Each time the program starts, it should
# retrieve the dictionary from the file and unpickle it.
